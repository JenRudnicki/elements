    <p style="color: antiquewhite"> Our team consisted of Jenny Rudnicki, Michael Coons, Levi Boenish and Tom Lee.
        We have two team members in g90 and two team members from g95. Our group decided
        to plan and utilize the strengths of each person to better the process. Jenny and Michael
        worked on the finding and utilizing the API link with the music while Levi 
        and Tom focused on styling and incorporating photos. 

        Most importantly our team realized that our different backgrounds were our strengths.
        We enjoyed working together and had a really fun day. Our group utilized the 
        agile scrum methodology to stay on track throughout the time.
